# GREP
Implementation of REGEX and GREP from scratch
## Heading2 REGEX: 
REGEX is an abbreviation for Regular Expression, which is a way of defining strings in the form of a pattern. This becomes incredibly useful for programmers or IT techs
who need to parse strings for particular patterns (e.g. an email address). This program implements a very redumentary REGEX interpreter, which is then used to perform
a string search within a particular file
## Heading2 GREP:
GREP is a Linux command line utility which searches for a string in a particular file directory. Grep contains many different ways to search for a string (in the 
form of flags), which I will be rolling out over the next month or two. For now, this is a very basic implementation of GREP.
